Infographic that summarizes the project goal
### Introduction/Background
Problem we aim to address, motivation, and goal  
Problem: The outcome of a football play is considered to be very unpredictable. The factors that go into it (weather, positions, remaining yards, etc) make it hard for a coach to judge in the moment which plays will allow the team to get the yards needed to succeed.  
Motivation: Being able to model the number of yards that will be gained by a play will yield a team a competitive advantage.  
Goal: To model the number of yards that will be gained in an NFL play based on the situation.
