### Introduction/Background
Problem we aim to address, motivation, and goal  
Problem: The outcome of a football play is considered to be very unpredictable. The factors that go into it (weather, positions, remaining yards, etc) make it hard for a coach to judge in the moment which plays will allow the team to get the yards needed to succeed.  
Motivation: Being able to model the number of yards that will be gained by a play will yield a team a competitive advantage.  
Goal: To model the number of yards that will be gained in an NFL play based on the situation.  
Disclaimer: For simplicity, we will not be including field goals, and for punts, we will model the number of yards gained after the ball is recieved.
### Methods
Outline of dataset we are planning on utilizing & techniques we intend to apply
For our project, we plan on using a [play by play dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016) from recent years.  
The dataset contains roughly 100 columns of data, with varying importance.  
We plan on applying ______, _______, and ______ techniques.

### Results
Talk about the results we are trying to achieve

### Discussion
Explain what the best outcome would be, and what the next steps would be
The best reasonable outcome would be for us to model 90% of plays successfully, where a successful model is defined as one that we get within 10% of the yards gained or lost.
